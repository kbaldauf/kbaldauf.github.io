If an organization is lucky enough to survive its infancy, then they will eventually be faced with scalability issues. How one handles these issues are often of the utmost importance to the future livelihood of the organization. Failure to swiftly and efficiently scale can often lead to the demise of the organization.

There are countless components that factor into scalability. Since covering all of them is not feasible, below I have identified what I deem to be the two most important factors.

### Model

### Closing Thoughts

<div class="message"> As the age old contradiction goes, "never say never." </div>

Does successfully managing makeup and model guarantee that an organization will never fail? No, not necessarily. However, these major factors are essential to the successful growth of an organization.
